## FAQs

{{< spoiler text="'Silent killer'? Sounds dramatic. Is it really that serious? üò≥" >}}
Absolutely! The term "silent killer" is no exaggeration. ASCVD often operates under the radar, showing no symptoms until it strikes with potentially deadly consequences. It's the leading cause of death globally, making it crucial for us to pay attention and act early.

{{< spoiler text="What is 'ASCVD'?... ...the Dummies' version" >}}  
ASCVD (Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease) is like sediment in a pipe, silently building up until the flow is blocked.
Our heart and brain's vessels are like the plumbing in a mansion. Over time, just as pipes can clog with sediment, our arteries gather harmful deposits. If unchecked, this leads to blockages. Unlike a noticeable slow drain at home, ASCVD silently builds until it's a critical issue with sudden deadly heart attack or paralizing brain stroke.

Picture a pristine mountain slope after a fresh snowfall. Somewhere, a tiny snowball starts rolling. At first, it's barely noticeable, gathering just a bit of snow as it begins its descent during your childhood and teenage years. But as it continues, it picks up speed and mass. By the time you're soaking in life's adventures in your 40s and 50s, that snowball might have transformed into a formidable avalanche. Acting now, when it's just a snowball, gives you the power to redirect its path, ensuring the mountain remains serene and undisturbed. Prevention is like planting barriers early on, so that snowball never gets its chance to wreak havoc. üå®Ô∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è
