## Testing

Hello, fellow health warriors! 💚

Let’s dive into the sciencey waters of heart protection. 💙 Imagine gearing up with a shield that can spot the silent assassin before it even strikes! Thanks to cutting-edge science, we’ve got tests, some of which you only need to take once in your lifetime, that can clue you into the stealthy moves of ASCVD. 🕵️‍♂️ Blood tests like Lp(a) and APOE are your secret agents, sniffing out risks early on. And, oh, don’t forget the health history of your close kin; it’s like a map leading to hidden treasures of knowledge! 🗺️ To fortify our defenses, keeping an eye on the notorious ApoB is crucial. It’s like watching the villain's every move, much more handy than just tracking the infamous LDL-C (a.k.a. the bad cholesterol guy 🦹‍♂️). If ApoB is playing hard to find, the formula LDL-C minus HDL-C is your backup plan. 📊

## Magic Meds

In our battle against ASCVD, we have a brigade of magical meds! 🌟 A wise doc would tailor your armor, trying different concoctions to find your perfect fit. 🧙‍♂️ Statins are our old, reliable friends, usually starting the journey with Rosuvastatin, moving to Pravastatin if needed, and exploring others to find your match. These meds work their magic by controlling cholesterol creation, making the liver work in our favor! Ezetimibe is another ally, helping us by reducing cholesterol recycling in our bodies. PCSK9i, a newer member of our arsenal, mimics those rare, lucky folks with almost no ApoB, making it a promising tool as their prices fall!  And, an old safe med, Colchine, has been just approved to focus on reducing inflammation in our pipes, protecting them from the damage by ApoB by having sturdier pipes' walls.  Remember, some docs might not have the latest intel or prefer waiting for disaster to strike before acting. Stay informed and be your own health hero! 🦸‍♂️💪

## Proactive Pressure Patrol

Pressure check! 🧐 Monitoring blood pressure is like guarding the gates to our castle. 🏰 Any number higher than 130/85 (or above 120/80 with meds), and we need to act fast! To get the right readings, it’s crucial to relax, take multiple measurements on both arms, and average them out—yes, it takes time but it’s worth it! 🕰️ Our real foe is silent and sneaky, so a proper guard against it is vital. Equip yourself with knowledge, and make sure your health guardians are up to date and proactive in the fight against this silent villain! ⚔️🛡️


## Quiz

{{< spoiler text="What is the recommended way to monitor blood pressure accurately?" >}}
The correct way to monitor blood pressure is to relax and wait 5 minutes without moving, then take a measurement on one arm, wait another 5 minutes and take a measurement on the other arm, repeating this process at least 3 times to get an average. This at-home exercise gives the true picture of your blood pressure levels.
