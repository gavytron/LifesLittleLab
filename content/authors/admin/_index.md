Hey there, cosmic travelers! I'm Pristy 🚀, your pilot on this interstellar journey called 'Life’s Little Lab'. When I'm not geeking out over Stoicism 📖 or decoding the latest in AI 🤖, you’ll find me whipping up a sugar-free treat 🍰, dancing away, or even immersed in the digital world (code is poetry, right?). But, here’s a secret: everything I share, I swear by. From sunrise workouts 🏋️‍♀️ to mindful munching 🥑, I live and breathe what I preach. Ready to join the ride? Let's glow and grow together! 💫
