Behind every cosmic pilot is an incredible co-pilot, and that's me, Andrea! üõ†Ô∏è The guy ensuring our spaceship stays up and running. When I'm not coding fun challenges on CodinGame or marvelling at Stoicism, I'm mirroring Pristy‚Äôs healthy vibes, from pumping iron üèãÔ∏è to popping supplements üíä. While you might not hear much from me, just know, every pixel you love on this site has a bit of my geeky touch! üòâ
